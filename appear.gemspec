    Appear is a tool for revealing a given process in your terminal. Given a
    process ID, `appear` finds the terminal emulator view (be it a window, tab, or
    pane) containing that process and shows it to you. Appear understands terminal
    multiplexers like `tmux`, so if your target process is in a multiplexer
    session, `appear` will reveal a client connected to that session, or start one
    if needed.

    This project intends to support all POSIX operating systems eventually, but
    currently only supports macOS.
