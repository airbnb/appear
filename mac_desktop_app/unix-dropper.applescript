 *
 * when saved as an application (open in Script Editor, then choose
 * File->Export...), this script can be used to process files or folders with a
 * Unix script via drag-and-drop.
 *
 * You can customize the preferences of your Unix script by opening the
 * application the regular way.
 *
 * Your script will be called as a sh function, so you can process $@ using
 * `shift` or something.
 *
 * Heplful documentation for maintainers:
 *   Technical Note TN2065 - do shell script in AppleScript
 *   https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/technotes/tn2065/_index.html
 *
 * Here's the default script that this app will run, creaetd from the default
 * property `user_unix_command`, defined below, as though the dropped files were
 * "first", "second", "third".
 *
 * ```sh
 * #!/bin/sh
 * script-wrapper () {
 * ARG_C='3'
 * ARG_1='first'
 * ARG_2='second'
 * ARG_3='third'
 * say "dropped $ARG_C files. first file: $ARG_0"
 * }
 * # we do this so you can use "$@"
 * # and unix conventions if you're unix-y
 * script-wrapper first second third
 * ```

--- this is a stored user preference.
--- this is the default, but it can be set as a preference in a .plist if this script is saved as an applicication
property user_unix_command : default_command

--- this function runs when the user opens the application by double-clicking it.
--- uer can adjust the user_unix_command by opening the application
